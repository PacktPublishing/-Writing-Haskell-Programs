# Writing Haskell Programs [Video]
This is the code repository for [Writing Haskell Programs [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/writing-haskell-programs-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787283329), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Writing Haskell Programs aims to take developers familiar with the basics of the Haskell programming language and introduce them to more of the practical concerns and pragmatics of developing nontrivial Haskell programs.

We will talk about development environments, including editors, and how to set ourselves up to be productive in Haskell. We will discuss the details of the Stack build tool to establish a streamlined edit, build, execute and test cycle.

Furthermore, we will learn how to structure our Haskell programs and work on projects consisting of multiple targets. Finally, we will spend some time looking at how Haskell developers can take advantage of the large amount of existing open-source Haskell software that we can reuse in our programs.

This course is specifically aimed at anybody who knows the essentials of the Haskell programming language and who is interested in moving onto developing real programs and consuming third-party packages.
